# Epoch2

Second major iteration of Screeps OS.

## Useful commands

**Deploy:**

    yarn run deploy

This will deploy to the same server that your screeps-multimeter is currently pointing at.

**Run the local automated tests:**

    yarn run test

**Deploy the online tests bundle:**

    yarn run deploy-test

Note that this deploys to the main branch which may seriously interrupt your operations.
